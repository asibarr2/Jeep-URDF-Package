# Things to keep in mind:

If the model is not uploading properly: 
  - Install the xacro package (https://github.com/ros/xacro) in your catkin workspace
  - Ensure that you are specifying the correct directory path to your meshes folder
  - Make sure you have all the .STL files you need placed in your /meshes folder
