# Jeep-URDF-Package
URDF Package (ROS Melodic) for simulating Jeep in Rviz


# Things to keep in mind:

If the model is not uploading properly, install the xacro package (https://github.com/ros/xacro) in your catkin workspace and ensure that you are specifying the correct directory path to your meshes folder.
